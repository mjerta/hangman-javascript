# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman Game! This project was initially created during a coding Wednesday session at school, where we focused on building a Hangman game. I chose to implement it in vanilla JavaScript. In my spare time, I polished the game by adding some basic styling and a little story to enhance the experience. If you enjoy it, feel free to clone the repository and have fun with it!

## Features

- **Vanilla JavaScript**: The game is built using pure JavaScript without any external libraries.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Guess the word letter by letter. You have a limited number of attempts before the game ends.
- **Basic Styling**: Simple and clean design to enhance the user experience.
- **Story Element**: A small storyline to make the game more engaging.

## How to Play

1. The game will display a series of blank spaces representing the letters of the word to guess.
2. Use your keyboard to guess letters. Correct guesses will reveal the letters in the word.
3. Incorrect guesses will deplete your remaining attempts.
4. The game ends when you either guess the word correctly or run out of attempts.
